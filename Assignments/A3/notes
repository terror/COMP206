- take in some input directory

- this input directory contains log files

- parse these log files
  - generate a CSV file (logdata.csv) in the CWD
    a bunch of records
    form: process id, message id, process id, broadcast time

**** logdata.csv ****

high level logic:

- for each process log file, go through its message id's
  - then foreach `host:port:id` (unique identifier) in the receivers logfile, we can add an entry
    we need two things:
      - receive time
      - delivery time

format: <sender>,<message>,<receiver>,<broadcast-time>,<receive-time>,<delivery-time>

**** stats.csv ****

format: 'broadcaster' 'nummsgs' receivers...
         broadcasters  nummsgs  % nummsgs
              .          .          .
              .          .          .
              .          .          .
              .          .          .
              .          .          .
